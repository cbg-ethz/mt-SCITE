These scripts can help you set up for mt-SCITE analysis.

1) The compute_mutation_probability.py script allows you to generate mutation probability matrices for a range of error rates, given your read count data are in numpy format. Check the script itself for further details.

2) The cv.py script allows you to learn an error rate using k-fold cross validation.
